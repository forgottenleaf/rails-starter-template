# Rails Starter Template

This project is simply a starter template I use for my Rails projects. Look at the gemfile if you want to see what libraries are included. It adds gems/support for things like PostgreSQL, FactoryGirl, Paperclip, AWS, RSpec, etc.

*NOTE: Some manual configuration will still be needed.*
